    "Congratulations! Due to your strong performance in the first three courses, you landed a job as a reinforcement learning engineer at the hottest new non-revenue generating unicorn, MoonShot Technologies (MST). Times are busy at MST, which is preparing for its initial public offering (IPO) at the end of the fiscal year, and your labor is much needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like many successful startups, MST is exceedingly concerned with the valuation that it will receive at its IPO (as this valuation determines the price at which its existing venture capitalist shareholders will be able to sell their shares). Accordingly, to whet the appetites of potential investors, MST has set its sights on accomplishing a technological tour de force &mdash; a lunar landing &mdash; before the year is out. But it is not just any mundane lunar landing that MST aspires toward. Rather than the more sensible approach of employing techniques from aerospace engineering to pilot its spacecraft, MST endeavors to wow investors by training an agent to do the job via reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is clearly not practical for a reinforcement learning agent to be trained tabula rasa with real rockets &mdash; even the pockets of venture capitalists have their limits. Instead, MST aims to build a simulator that is realistic enough to train an agent that can be deployed in the real world. This will be a difficult project, and will require building a realistic simulator, choosing the right reinforcement learning algorithm, implementing this algorithm, and optimizing the hyperparameters for this algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, as the newly hired reinforcement learning engineer, you have been staffed to lead the project. In this notebook, you will take the first steps by building a lunar lander environment."

    "* **get_velocity** - returns an array representing the x, y velocity of the lander. Both the x and y velocity are in the range $[0, 60]$.\n",
    "\n",

    "* **get_angle** - returns a scalar representing the angle of the lander. The angle is in the range $[0, 359]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **get_position** - returns an array representing the x, y position of the lander. Both the x and y position of the agent are in the range $[0, 100]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **get_landing_zone** - returns an array representing the x, y position of the landing zone. Both the x, y coordinates are in the range $[1, 100]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **get_fuel** - returns a scalar representing the remaining amount of fuel. Fuel starts at $100$ and is in range $[0, 100]$.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. The lander's angle taken values in $[0, 359]$. It is completely vertical at $0$ degrees. **The lander will crash if** it touches the ground when ``5 < angle < 355`` (angle differs from vertical by more than $5$ degrees).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The lander will crash if** it has yet to land and ``fuel <= 0`` (it runs out of fuel).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. MST would like to save money on fuel when it is possible **(using less fuel is preferred)**.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Evaluating your reward function\n",
    "\n",
    "Designing the best reward function for an objective is a challenging task - it is not clear what the term “best reward function” even means, let alone how to find it. Consequently, rather than evaluating your reward function by quantitative metrics, we merely ask that you check that its behavior is qualitatively reasonable. For this purpose, we provide a series of test cases below. In each case we show a transition and explain how a reward function that we implemented behaves. As you read, check how your own reward behaves in each scenario and judge for yourself whether it acts appropriately. (For the latter parts of the capstone you will use our implementation of the lunar lander environment, so don’t worry if your reward function isn’t exactly the same as ours. The purpose of this of this notebook is to gain experience implementing environments and reward functions.)"

    "So far in the course you have implemented the agent part of each of the experiments. In this notebook you will learn to implement environments in the RL-Glue framework. This is an important part of doing reinforcement learning research. While there are many great existing environments that you can utilize you often will want to create your own to test a specific part of an RL algorithm, or to see how an algorithm handles a specific situation. Being able to create your own environments makes this easy and as you will see in this notebook, creating environments in RL-Glue is really clear and simple.\n",

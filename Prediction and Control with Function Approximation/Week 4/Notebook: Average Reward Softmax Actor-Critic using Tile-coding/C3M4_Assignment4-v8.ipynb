    "## Pendulum Swing-Up Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will be using a Pendulum environment, adapted from [Santamaría et al. (1998)](http://www.incompleteideas.net/papers/SSR-98.pdf). This is also the same environment that we used in the lecture. The diagram below illustrates the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"data/pendulum_env.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment consists of single pendulum that can swing 360 degrees. The pendulum is actuated by applying a torque on its pivot point. The goal is to get the pendulum to balance up-right from its resting position (hanging down at the bottom with no velocity) and maintain it as long as possible. The pendulum can move freely, subject only to gravity and the action applied by the agent. \n",
    "\n",
    "The state is 2-dimensional, which consists of the current angle $\\beta \\in [-\\pi, \\pi]$ (angle from the vertical upright position) and current angular velocity $\\dot{\\beta} \\in (-2\\pi, 2\\pi)$. The angular velocity is constrained in order to avoid damaging the pendulum system. If the angular velocity reaches this limit during simulation, the pendulum is reset to the resting position. \n",
    "The action is the angular acceleration, with discrete values $a \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ applied to the pendulum.\n",
    "For more details on environment dynamics you can refer to the original paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to swing-up the pendulum and maintain its upright angle. Hence, the reward is the negative absolute angle from the vertical position: $R_{t} = -|\\beta_{t}|$\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, since the goal is to reach and maintain a vertical position, there are no terminations nor episodes. Thus this problem can be formulated as a continuing task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the Mountain Car task, the action in this pendulum environment is not strong enough to move the pendulum directly to the desired position. The agent must learn to first move the pendulum away from its desired position and gain enough momentum to successfully swing-up the pendulum. And even after reaching the upright position the agent must learn to continually balance the pendulum in this unstable position."

    "## Section 1: Create Tile Coding Helper Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we are going to build a tile coding class for our agent that will make it easier to make calls to our tile coder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tile-coding is introduced in Section 9.5.4 of the textbook as a way to create features that can both provide good generalization and discrimination. We have already used it in our last programming assignment as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the last programming assignment, we are going to make a function specific for tile coding for our Pendulum Swing-up environment. We will also use the [Tiles3 library](http://incompleteideas.net/tiles/tiles3.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the tile coder working we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) create an index hash table using tc.IHT(), \n",
    "    2) scale the inputs for the tile coder based on number of tiles and range of values each input could take\n",
    "    3) call tc.tileswrap to get active tiles back.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we need to make one small change to this tile coder.\n",
    "Note that in this environment the state space contains angle, which is between $[-\\pi, \\pi]$. If we tile-code this state space in the usual way, the agent may think the value of states corresponding to an angle of $-\\pi$ is very different from angle of $\\pi$ when in fact they are the same! To remedy this and allow generalization between angle $= -\\pi$ and angle $= \\pi$, we need to use **wrap tile coder**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usage of wrap tile coder is almost identical to the original tile coder, except that we also need to provide the `wrapwidth` argument for the dimension we want to wrap over (hence only for angle, and `None` for angular velocity). More details of wrap tile coder is also provided in [Tiles3 library](http://incompleteideas.net/tiles/tiles3.html).\n"

    "### Performance Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate performance, we plotted both the return and exponentially weighted average reward over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first plot, the return is negative because the reward is negative at every state except when the pendulum is in the upright position. As the policy improves over time, the agent accumulates less negative reward, and thus the return decreases slowly. Towards the end the slope is almost flat indicating the policy has stabilized to a good policy. When using this plot however, it can be difficult to distinguish whether it has learned an optimal policy. The near-optimal policy in this Pendulum Swing-up Environment is to maintain the pendulum in the upright position indefinitely, getting near 0 reward at each time step. We would have to examine the slope of the curve but it can be hard to compare the slope of different curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second plot using exponential average reward gives a better visualization. We can see that towards the end the value is near 0, indicating it is getting near 0 reward at each time step. Here, the exponentially weighted average reward shouldn't be confused with the agent’s internal estimate of the average reward. To be more specific, we used an exponentially weighted average of the actual reward without initial bias (Refer to Exercise 2.7 from the textbook (p.35) to read more about removing the initial bias). If we used sample averages instead, later rewards would have decreasing impact on the average and would not be able to represent the agent's performance with respect to its current policy effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easier to see whether the agent has learned a good policy in the second plot than the first plot. If the learned policy is optimal, the exponential average reward would be close to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, how did we pick the best meta-parameter from the sweeps? A common method would be to pick the meta-parameter that results in the largest Area Under the Curve (AUC). However, this is not always what we want. We want to find a set of meta-parameters that learns a good final policy. When using AUC as the criteria, we may pick meta-parameters that allows the agent to learn fast but converge to a worse policy. In our case, we selected the meta-parameter setting that obtained the most exponential average reward over the last 5000 time steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameter Sensitivity\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to finding the best meta-parameters it is also equally important to plot **parameter sensitivity curves** to understand how our algorithm behaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our simulated Pendulum problem, we can extensively test our agent with different meta-parameter configurations but it would be quite expensive to do so in real life. Parameter sensitivity curves can provide us insight into how our algorithms might behave in general. It can help us identify a good range of each meta-parameters as well as how sensitive the performance is with respect to each meta-parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the sensitivity curves for the three step-sizes we swept over:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"data/sensitivity_combined.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 1000px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "On the y-axis we use the performance measure, which is the average of the exponential average reward over the 5000 time steps, averaged over 50 different runs. On the x-axis is the meta-parameter we are testing. For the given meta-parameter, the remaining meta-parameters are chosen such that it obtains the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The curves are quite rounded, indicating the agent performs well for these wide range of values. It indicates that the agent is not too sensitive to these meta-parameters. Furthermore, looking at the y-axis values we can observe that average reward step-size is particularly less sensitive than actor step-size and critic step-size.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we know that we have sufficiently covered a wide range of meta-parameters? It is important that the best value is not on the edge but in the middle of the meta-parameter sweep range in these sensitivity curves. Otherwise this may indicate that there could be better meta-parameter values that we did not sweep over."

    "You have implemented your own **Average Reward Actor-Critic with Softmax Policy** agent in the Pendulum Swing-up Environment. You implemented the environment based on information about the state/action space and transition dynamics. Furthermore, you have learned how to implement an agent in a continuing task using the average reward formulation. We parameterized the policy using softmax of action-preferences over discrete action spaces, and used Actor-Critic to learn the policy.\n",

    "    1. Implement softmax actor-critic agent on a continuing task using the average reward formulation.\n",
    "    2. Understand how to parameterize the policy as a function to learn, in a discrete action environment.\n",
